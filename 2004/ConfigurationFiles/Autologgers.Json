Once you enroll your device to your workplace environment or Azure AD, your organization will be able to manage your PC and collect information about you (including your location). It might add or remove apps or content, change settings, disable features, prevent you from removing your company account, or reset your PC.”. The OOBE part means “out-of-box experience”.  This trace records events around domain or Azure AD join.  Normally provisioned VDI VMs are already joined, so this logging is unnecessary."

Current buffers are 4, buffer size is 16.  Those numbers reflect the amount of physical RAM reserved for this trace.  Because my VM does not use WLAN, AKA “wireless”, this trace is doing nothing for my VM now, and will not as long as I do not use wireless.  Therefore the recommendation to disable this trace and free these resources."
